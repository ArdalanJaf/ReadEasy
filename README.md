# Read Easy

This app was made by four students at The Jump Digital School as part of a hackathon challenge. The goal was to produce an app to help children learn to read. We were given 7 hours to complete the challenge.

Built in function-based React with a text-to-speach API (api.voicerss.org), in order to help children learning the alphabet. GSAP was also used to add some animations. Having a little extra time we added silly sentences to practice pronunciation, as well as a letter tracker.

Overall, the combination of working in a team and to a quick deadline made it a very satisfying and enjoyable experience!
